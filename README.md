If you’ve been asking, “Why Is My Laptop So Slow?”, you’re not alone. Many users face this frustrating problem. A slow laptop can affect your productivity, streaming, or even simple browsing. Luckily, there are easy ways to boost speed.

One common reason your laptop is slow is too many startup programs. These apps run automatically and drain your memory. Another culprit is a cluttered hard drive. Over time, files and apps accumulate, making your system sluggish. Malware and viruses can also sneak in, slowing performance.

To fix these issues, start by cleaning your hard drive and uninstalling unnecessary programs. Running a trusted antivirus scan is essential. Updating your operating system and drivers can also improve speed. Sometimes, adding more RAM or switching to a solid-state drive (SSD) makes a huge difference.
